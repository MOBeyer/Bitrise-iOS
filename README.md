# Pro tip: use `configs/user.xcconfig` for convenience.

You can define workflowIDs preset for each apps by using `TRIGGER_BUILD_WORKFLOW_IDS`. This way your team members do not have to manually add workflowIDs.
The format is in JSON. Use AppSlug as a key and set whitespace separated string as workflowIDs.

e.g.
```
TRIGGER_BUILD_WORKFLOW_IDS={ "fdc3abbc325071dd": "beta danger release test" }
```

Put `TRIGGER_BUILD_WORKFLOW_IDS` in `configs/user.xcconfig` and the app will read and store it in database at initial launch.

`user.xcconfig` is ignored by git. (listed in .gitignore)
